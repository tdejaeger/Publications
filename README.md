# Publications

All my first author publications (.pdf) in peer-to-peer reviews:  

- de Jaeger et al. 2018b: Observed Type II supernova colours from the CSP-I.  
-> **First extensive Type II supernovae observed colour studies demonstrating that difference in colours are due to intrinsic properties**

- de Jaeger el al. 2018a: SN 2016esw: a luminous Type II supernova observed within the first day after the explosion.  
-> **An interacting Type II supernovae observed less than 1 day after the explosion**

- de Jaeger et al. 2017b: SN 2016jhj at redshift 0.34: extending the Type II supernova Hubble diagram using the standard candle method.  
-> **For the first time, a Type II supernova Hubble diagram is extending at redshift > 0.3**

# Presentations   

A small fractions of the presentations I gave for general audience.   

- Expanding Universe Final: General lecture (45 min) on the expanding Universe given at the City of College San Francisco (California, USA).  

- Lisboa: Seminar (45 min) on the supernova and my research given at the Instituto Superior Tecnico (Lisboa, Portugal).  

- Evening with star: General audience presentation (15 min) on type II supernovae at University of Berkeley (California, USA).  

- In the following link you can also find a presentation in spanish when I was doing guided visit of the Calan Observatory for general audience and schools  https://prezi.com/cs7jj-q6bs8f/observatorio-astronomico-nacional-cerro-calan/.
