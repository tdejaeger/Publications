# Presentations   

A small fractions of the presentations I gave for general audiences.   

- Expanding Universe Final: General lecture (45 min) on the expanding Universe given at the City of College San Francisco (California, USA).  

- Lisboa: General seminar (45 min) on supernova including my research given at the Instituto Superior Tecnico (Lisboa, Portugal).  

- Evening with star: General audience presentation (15 min) on type II supernovae at University of Berkeley (California, USA).  

- In the following link you can also find a presentation in spanish when I was doing guided visits at Calan Observatory (Santiago, Chile) for general audience and schools  https://prezi.com/cs7jj-q6bs8f/observatorio-astronomico-nacional-cerro-calan/.
