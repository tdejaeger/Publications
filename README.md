All my first author publications (pdf) in peer-to-peer reviews:  

- de Jaeger et al. 2018b: Observed Type II supernova colours from the CSP-I.  
-> **First extensive Type II supernovae observed colour studies demonstrating that difference in colours are due to intrinsic properties**

- de Jaeger el al. 2018a: SN 2016esw: a luminous Type II supernova observed within the first day after the explosion.  
-> **An interacting Type II supernovae observed less than 1 day after the explosion**

- de Jaeger et al. 2017b: SN 2016jhj at redshift 0.34: extending the Type II supernova Hubble diagram using the standard candle method.  
-> **For the first time, a Type II supernova Hubble diagram is extending at redshift > 0.3**

- de Jaeger el al. 2017a: A Type II Supernova Hubble diagram from the CSP-I, SDSS-II, and SNLS surveys.  
-> **A new independent evidence for dark energy using Type II supernovae**

- de Jaeger et al. 2016: PhD thesis manuscript: Independent evidence for the cosmic acceleration from Type II supernovae (supervised by Mario Hamuy)

- de Jaeger et al. 2015b: A Hubble diagram from Type II Supernovae based solely on photometry: the Photometric-Colour Method.  
-> **A new method to measure extragalactic distances from photometry, with no input of spectral information**
